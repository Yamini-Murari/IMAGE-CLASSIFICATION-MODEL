*DESCRIPTION* : 
-- TASK OVERVIEW : This project shows how to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow and Keras to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model learns to identify digits 0-9 from grayscale 28x28 pixels images. CNNs are a robust form of neural network particularly well-suited for image classification problems because they have an innate ability to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features in a process called backpropagation.
